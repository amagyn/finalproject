<div class="branddealsdesc"><h2> One of the earliest questions aspiring influencers will ask<br> themselves is: How do I start working with brands?<br>

    An influencer's inbox — whether it's email or direct messages on social media — is<br> often where that process of getting in contact with a brand begins.<br>
    
    Many influencers, like Gigi Kovach (a part-time lifestyle influencer),<br> go straight to email to reach out to brands for collaborations. What<br> do you say when reaching out to brands? Kovach told Insider that<br> she keeps a "pitch bank" of email templates handy when she's approaching brands<br> and potential sponsors.

    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, other influencers will contact brands<br> by cold DMing them on social media, like Instagram for a collaboration. 
<br>
<br>
Micro influencer Ashley Jones said that her<br> strategy consists of posting on Instagram about products she loves and tagging the brand.<br> She then reaches out to the brand to introduce herself and<br> explains why she'd like to work with them.<br> She'll often ask for a proper PR contact too, she said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LinkedIn is also a tool creators<br> utilize to connect with PR reps or influencer-marketing <br>contacts at brands. For instance, TikTok star London Lazerson uses LinkedIn to DM CEOs.<br>
