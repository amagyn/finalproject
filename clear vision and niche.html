<h1>Vision & Niche</h1>
</div>
    <div class="ndesc"><h2> Attract and engage your followers, find a niche topic that interests you enough<br> to develop regular content around it.<br> So what gets you excited? What topic makes you want<br> to get up in the morning, fire up the coffee machine, and hit the keyboard<br> to create the content your audience craves?<br> Let’s go there!</div></h2>
    
    <div class="visionandnicheV"><h2>Sit down, get comfortable, grab a snack, and start brainstorming<br> subtopics within your content category. Let the ideas flow!<br> Then, start making lists, advises successful content creator and influencer Keiko Lynn.<br> Keiko started out in high school as a fashion blogger, eventually<br> zooming in on vintage clothing and developing her own quirky, colorful style and brand.<br>

        “Ask yourself, ‘What are my interests?’<br> and ‘What am I most knowledgeable about?’” Keiko suggests.<br> “Make a list of both! If there is an area of overlap, that’s even better.<br> Say you’re vegan, you’re an excellent cook, you love<br> photography, and you have a weakness for comfort food. BOOM!: You can start a vegan comfort food blog.<br> Or maybe you’re a parent of three children, you love to travel, and you’ve become<br> a bit of an expert: There’s a great opportunity to blog about family-friendly travel tips and experiences.”<br></h2></div>
